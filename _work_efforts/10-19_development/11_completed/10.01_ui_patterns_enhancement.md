## Status: ✅ Completed

**Completed:** 2025-12-08 18:10 PST

## Objective

Apply proven UI layout patterns to improve the site's user experience, content discoverability, and visual appeal. Based on analysis of 12 timeless UI patterns from UXPin.

## Background

The current design uses a Wikipedia-inspired aesthetic with:
- `WikiBox` atom component (6 variants)
- Molecule components: `Disclaimer`, `DecisionMatrix`, `InfoBox`, `NavBox`
- Basic F-pattern layout with floating sidebars
- 800px max-width, centered content

## Patterns Analyzed

| Pattern | Applicability | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Cards | ⭐ High | Already exists (`TopicCard`) |
| Grids | ⭐ High | Already exists (`CardGrid`) |
| Magazine Layout | ⭐ High | ✅ Homepage redesigned |
| F-Pattern | 🔵 Already implemented | Floating sidebars |
| Container-free | 🔵 Already implemented | Wikipedia aesthetic |
| Z-Pattern | 🟡 Medium | Future: intro page CTAs |
| Split-Screen | 🟡 Medium | Future: comparisons |

## Tasks

- [x] Create _work_efforts folder structure
- [x] Create this work effort document
- [x] Analyze existing components (found TopicCard + CardGrid)
- [x] Redesign homepage with Magazine-style layout
- [x] Update devlog with progress
- [ ] Test responsive behavior (manual verification needed)

## What Was Done

### Discovery
Found existing components not being used on homepage:
- `TopicCard.astro` — Full card component with icon, tag, description
- `CardGrid.astro` — Responsive grid wrapper (2/3/4 columns)

### Homepage Redesign
Transformed `src/content/docs/index.mdx` with Magazine-style layout:

**Before:**
- Disclaimer
- Plain text intro
- Simple bullet list of links

**After:**
- Disclaimer
- Intro paragraph
- **Featured Tool** (full-width TopicCard for Decision Matrix)
- **The Protocol** section (2-column CardGrid)
- **Field Notes** section (single TopicCard)
- **Resources** section (single TopicCard)
- Horizontal dividers between sections

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/content/docs/index.mdx` | Magazine-style layout |
| `_docs/devlog/2025-12-08_devlog.md` | Added Session 5 |
| `_work_efforts/*` | Created structure |

## Key Insights

1. **Components already existed** — TopicCard and CardGrid were built but unused
2. **Magazine layout fits wiki model** — Featured content + categories + updates
3. **Cards work well for scannable content** — Per Fitts's Law, entire card clickable
4. **Grid is responsive** — 2 columns → 1 on mobile automatically
