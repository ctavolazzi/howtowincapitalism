# Work Effort: UI Pattern Enhancement

## Status: 🟢 Phase 1-3 Complete, Phase 4 Pending
**Started:** 2025-12-09 05:22
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-09 05:55

## Objective

Apply UI-Patterns.com design patterns to enhance the How To Win Capitalism wiki's user experience, navigation, and engagement.

## Background

Analysis of UI-Patterns.com catalog identified several patterns that align with the project's educational wiki format and financial autonomy theme.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Navigation & Structure (Priority: High) ✅
- [x] **Breadcrumbs component** — Show hierarchy (Home > Protocol > Topic)
- [x] **Cards component** — Topic overview cards for index pages
- [x] **Fat Footer** — Site-wide footer with links and resources

### Phase 2: Content Presentation (Priority: High) ✅
- [x] **Progressive Disclosure** — Collapsible detail sections (`Collapsible.astro`, `FAQ.astro`)
- [x] **See Also component** — Formalize related content linking
- [x] **Good Defaults** — Pre-filled examples in Decision Matrix (Job, Side Hustle, Housing)

### Phase 3: Engagement (Priority: Medium) ✅
- [x] **Completeness Meter** — Track protocol mastery progress (`CompletenessMeter.astro`)
- [x] **Blank Slate** — Onboarding for new users (`BlankSlate.astro`, used on Reports page)
- [ ] **Favorites** — Bookmark functionality (deferred to Phase 4)

### Phase 4: Future (Priority: Low)
- [ ] **Search Filters** — Filter by category
- [ ] **Tag Cloud** — Visualize concept relationships
- [ ] **Wizard** — Guided decision matrix builder

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. Create `Breadcrumbs.astro` atom component
2. Create `TopicCard.astro` molecule component
3. Update `index.mdx` to use cards layout
4. Add breadcrumbs to page template

### Next Session (Phase 2)
1. Add collapsible sections to existing components
2. Create `SeeAlso.astro` component
3. Add example presets to Decision Matrix

## Technical Notes

- Components follow atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Wikipedia aesthetic must be maintained
- Starlight framework constraints apply
- Design tokens defined in `custom.css`

## Success Criteria

- [x] Navigation feels intuitive (breadcrumbs work)
- [x] Index pages show content previews (cards)
- [x] Users can track progress (completeness meter)
- [x] Consistent visual language maintained
