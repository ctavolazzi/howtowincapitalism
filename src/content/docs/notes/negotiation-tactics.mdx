## Why Negotiation Matters

Not negotiating a job offer can cost you **$500,000+** over a career.

**The math:** A $5,000 difference at age 25, compounded at 3% annual raises over 40 years = $500,000+ in lost lifetime earnings. Plus lost 401(k) matches, bonuses calculated as percentage of salary, and Social Security benefits.

Most people don't negotiate. Those who do typically get 5-20% more. The only cost is a slightly uncomfortable conversation.

## The Core Principles

<Steps>
1. **Never accept immediately** — Always ask for time to consider
2. **Get the offer in writing** — Before negotiating
3. **Negotiate after they want you** — Leverage is highest post-offer
4. **Be collaborative, not adversarial** — "Help me say yes" framing
5. **Have alternatives** — Real or perceived BATNA (Best Alternative)
</Steps>

## Salary Negotiation: New Job

### Phase 1: Deflect Early Questions

When asked about salary expectations early in the process:

<Collapsible title="Script: Deflecting Salary Questions">

**Recruiter:** "What are your salary expectations?"

**You:** "I'm flexible on compensation and more focused on finding the right fit. I'd love to learn more about the role first—what's the budgeted range for this position?"

**If pressed:** "I'm sure we can find something that works for both of us once we determine I'm the right fit. What range are you working with?"

**Why:** Whoever names a number first often loses. Let them anchor.

</Collapsible>

### Phase 2: Receive the Offer

<Steps>
1. **Express enthusiasm** — "Thank you, I'm excited about this opportunity"
2. **Don't react to numbers** — Neutral acknowledgment only
3. **Ask for time** — "I'd like to review the full package. Can I have until [2-3 days]?"
4. **Get it in writing** — "Could you send the offer details in an email?"
</Steps>

### Phase 3: The Counter

<Collapsible title="Script: Countering an Offer">

**Setup:** You received $95,000. Market rate is $100-110,000. You want $105,000.

**You:** "Thank you for the offer—I'm genuinely excited about joining the team. I've done some research, and based on my experience with [specific skill/achievement] and current market rates for this role, I was hoping we could discuss the base salary. Is there flexibility to move closer to $108,000?"

**Key elements:**
- Gratitude (not entitlement)
- Justification (market data, specific skills)
- Specific number (not a range)
- Question format (collaborative)
- Ask for more than you need (leaves room)

</Collapsible>

<Aside type="tip" title="The Silence Technique">
After making your ask, stop talking. Silence is uncomfortable—let them fill it. Often they'll improve the offer just to break the tension.
</Aside>

### Phase 4: Handle Responses

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="If They Say Yes">
    Great! Get the revised offer in writing before accepting. Then accept promptly and professionally.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="If They Meet Halfway">
    Decide if it's acceptable. If close, you can try: "If you can get to $X, I can sign today." Creates urgency.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="If They Say No">
    "I understand. Is there flexibility in other areas—signing bonus, equity, vacation time, or start date?"

    Non-salary items are often easier to negotiate.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="If They Rescind">
    Extremely rare. If it happens, you dodged a bullet—that's not an employer you want.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Raise Negotiation: Current Job

Negotiating a raise is different—you have a relationship to maintain.

### Preparation (Weeks Before)

<Steps>
1. **Document wins** — Specific achievements with numbers
2. **Research market** — What are others paid for this role?
3. **Know the cycle** — When are raises typically decided?
4. **Read the room** — Company doing well? Budget season?
</Steps>

### The Conversation

<Collapsible title="Script: Asking for a Raise">

**You:** "I wanted to discuss my compensation. Over the past year, I've [specific achievement 1] which resulted in [metric], and [specific achievement 2]. I've also taken on [additional responsibility]. Based on my contributions and market rates for this role, I'd like to discuss adjusting my salary to $X. What are your thoughts?"

**Key elements:**
- Direct but not demanding
- Evidence-based (not "I need money")
- Specific ask (not "more money")
- Open to discussion

</Collapsible>

### If They Say "Not Now"

<Steps>
1. Ask what would need to happen for a raise
2. Get specific criteria and timeline in writing
3. Follow up at the agreed time
4. If they keep deferring, update your resume
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Don't Threaten to Leave">
"Give me a raise or I'll leave" rarely works and damages the relationship. Instead, quietly interview elsewhere. A real offer is better leverage than an empty threat.
</Aside>

## What to Negotiate Beyond Salary

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Signing bonus** | One-time, often easier to approve |
| **Equity/RSUs** | Can be significant at tech companies |
| **Vacation time** | Extra week = 2% raise equivalent |
| **Remote flexibility** | Saves commute time and money |
| **Start date** | Take time between jobs |
| **Title** | Affects future earning potential |
| **Professional development** | Conference budget, training |
| **Relocation** | If applicable, negotiate amount |

## Common Mistakes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Accepting Too Fast">
    Never accept on the spot. Even if the offer is great, take time. It's expected.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Being Apologetic">
    "I hate to ask, but..." undermines your position. You're not asking for a favor—you're establishing fair value.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Negotiating via Email Only">
    Email is fine for receiving offers, but negotiate via phone/video. Tone matters, and real-time conversation is more effective.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Lying About Offers">
    Fabricating competing offers is risky. They might call your bluff or rescind. Use real market data instead.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The Power of Walking Away

The best negotiating position is genuine willingness to walk away.

This comes from:
- **Emergency fund** — You're not desperate for the paycheck
- **In-demand skills** — Other options exist
- **Current employment** — You're not unemployed
- **Clear minimum** — You know your floor

If you can't walk away, you can't negotiate effectively. Build the position first.

## Practice Makes Better

Negotiation is a skill. Practice it:

- **Low-stakes practice** — Negotiate at flea markets, with service providers
- **Role play** — Practice scripts with friends
- **Debrief** — After each negotiation, what worked?

The discomfort decreases with experience. The returns compound.

## The Bottom Line

Negotiation is:
- **Expected** — Employers budget for it
- **Low-risk** — Offers are rarely rescinded
- **High-return** — Minutes of discomfort = years of higher pay
- **A skill** — Improves with practice

The worst they can say is no. The cost of not asking is guaranteed.
