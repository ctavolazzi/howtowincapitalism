## Blank Template

### Step 1: Define Your Options

| # | Option |
|---|--------|
| A | ___ |
| B | ___ |

| D | ___ |

### Step 2: Define Your Criteria and Weights

| Criterion | Weight (%) |
|-----------|------------|
| ___ | __% |
| ___ | __% |
| ___ | __% |
| ___ | __% |
| ___ | __% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

<Aside type="note" title="Weights Must Sum to 100%">
Weights represent relative importance. If cost matters twice as much as convenience, give cost 40% and convenience 20%.
</Aside>

### Step 3: Score Each Option (1-10)

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| ___ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| ___ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| ___ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| ___ | __ | __ | __ | __ |
| ___ | __ | __ | __ | __ |

### Step 4: Calculate Weighted Scores

For each option: (Score × Weight) for each criterion, then sum.

| Option | Calculation | Total |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| A | ___ | ___ |
| B | ___ | ___ |
| C | ___ | ___ |
| D | ___ | ___ |

### Step 5: Result

## How to Use This Template

<Steps>
1. **List 2-4 realistic options** — Don't include options you wouldn't actually choose
2. **Identify 3-5 criteria that matter** — What factors will determine success?
3. **Assign weights** — Force rank importance, must total 100%
4. **Score honestly (1-10)** — 1 = worst, 10 = best, 5 = average
5. **Calculate totals** — Math reveals the answer
6. **Sanity check** — Does the result feel right? If not, adjust weights
</Steps>

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Exceptional, best possible |
| 8-9 | Very good, strong performer |
| 6-7 | Above average, solid |
| 5 | Average, acceptable |
| 3-4 | Below average, weak |
| 1-2 | Poor, significant concerns |

<Aside type="tip" title="Avoid All 5s">
If everything scores 5, you're not being honest. Force differentiation between options.
</Aside>

| Big Tech | (9×0.30)+(7×0.25)+(6×0.20)+(8×0.15)+(5×0.10) | **7.35** |

**Winner:** Big Tech Offer (7.35)

**Note:** If the scores are very close (within 0.5), consider which criteria you might be under-weighting.

## Common Use Cases

| Decision | Typical Criteria |

## Spreadsheet Version

For complex decisions, use a spreadsheet:

```
=SUMPRODUCT(scores, weights)
```

Or use our interactive [Decision Matrix Tool](/protocol/decision-matrix/).

---

## When NOT to Use This

- **Obvious decisions** — Don't overcomplicate simple choices
- **Emotional decisions** — Relationships, passion projects (matrix is a data point, not the answer)
- **Insufficient information** — Garbage in, garbage out
- **One dominant factor** — If cost is 90% of your decision, just pick the cheapest
