## Tax Optimization Overview

Tax optimization isn't about cheating—it's about using the rules as designed. The tax code rewards certain behaviors (saving for retirement, healthcare, homeownership). This guide shows you how to capture those benefits.

## The Tax-Advantaged Account Priority

Use accounts in this order to minimize lifetime taxes:

<Steps>
1. **401(k) to employer match** — Instant 50-100% return (free money)
2. **HSA to max** — Triple tax advantage (deduction + growth + withdrawal)
3. **401(k) to max** — $23,000/year (2024)
4. **Roth IRA to max** — $7,000/year (2024), tax-free growth
5. **Taxable brokerage** — After tax-advantaged space exhausted
</Steps>

See [Tax-Advantaged Accounts](/protocol/tax-advantaged-accounts/) for detailed explanations.

## The Big Three Deductions

### 1. Retirement Contributions

| Account | 2024 Limit | Tax Benefit |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Traditional 401(k) | $23,000 | Deduction at marginal rate |
| Traditional IRA | $7,000 | Deduction (income limits apply) |
| SEP-IRA (self-employed) | $69,000 or 25% of income | Deduction |

**Impact:** Maxing a 401(k) at 24% bracket saves **$5,520** in taxes.

### 2. Health Savings Account (HSA)

| Status | 2024 Limit | Tax Benefit |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Individual | $4,150 | Deduction + tax-free growth + tax-free withdrawal |
| Family | $8,300 | Same triple benefit |

**Impact:** HSA contributions are the only "triple tax-advantaged" account. Use it.

### 3. Standard vs. Itemized Deductions

| Filing Status | 2024 Standard Deduction |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Single | $14,600 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $29,200 |
| Head of Household | $21,900 |

**Itemize only if:** Mortgage interest + state/local taxes + charitable giving + medical expenses > standard deduction.

## Tax-Efficient Investment Strategies

### Asset Location

Place investments in the right account type:

| Investment | Best Location | Why |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| Bonds / Bond funds | 401(k), IRA | Interest taxed as income |
| REITs | 401(k), IRA | Dividends taxed as income |
| High-turnover funds | 401(k), IRA | Frequent capital gains |
| Index funds | Taxable | Low turnover, qualified dividends |
| International stocks | Taxable | Foreign tax credit available |
| Municipal bonds | Taxable | Already tax-free |

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

When investments drop, sell and immediately buy a similar (not identical) fund:

<Steps>
1. **Sell losing investment** — Realize the loss
2. **Buy similar fund** — Stay invested (e.g., swap S&P 500 for Total Market)
3. **Use loss to offset gains** — Reduces tax on winners
4. **Carry forward excess** — Up to $3,000/year against income
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Wash Sale Rule">
Don't buy back the same or "substantially identical" investment within 30 days before or after the sale. This voids the loss.
</Aside>

## Timing Strategies

### Income Shifting

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Defer income** | High-income year (push bonus to January) |
| **Accelerate income** | Low-income year (exercise options, sell assets) |
| **Roth conversion** | Low-income year (convert traditional to Roth) |

### Deduction Timing

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bunch charitable giving** | Every other year to exceed standard deduction |
| **Prepay property taxes** | December (if itemizing) |
| **Accelerate medical expenses** | If close to 7.5% AGI threshold |

## Common Tax Mistakes

<Collapsible title="Not contributing to 401(k) match">
**Cost:** Literally free money left on table.

**Fix:** Contribute at least enough to get full employer match before anything else.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Ignoring HSA">
**Cost:** Missing the only triple tax-advantaged account.

**Fix:** If you have a high-deductible health plan, max your HSA. Use it as a stealth retirement account.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Holding bonds in taxable accounts">
**Cost:** Bond interest taxed at ordinary income rates (up to 37%).

**Fix:** Put bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, stocks in taxable.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Not harvesting losses">
**Cost:** Paying unnecessary capital gains taxes.

**Fix:** Harvest losses in December (or anytime), carry forward indefinitely.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Forgetting state taxes">
**Cost:** Missing state-specific deductions and credits.

**Fix:** Check your state's 529 deduction, property tax circuit breakers, and other state-specific benefits.
</Collapsible>
