import DecisionMatrix from '../../../components/molecules/DecisionMatrix.astro';
import { makeDecision } from '../../../lib/tools';

export const investmentResult = makeDecision({
  options: ["401(k)", "Roth IRA", "Taxable Brokerage"],
  criteria: ["Tax Advantage", "Flexibility", "Growth Potential", "Employer Match"],
  scores: {
    "401(k)": [9, 3, 7, 10],
    "Roth IRA": [8, 6, 8, 0],
    "Taxable Brokerage": [2, 10, 7, 0]
  },
  weights: [0.3, 0.2, 0.25, 0.25]
});

A **decision matrix** is a quantitative tool for comparing multiple options against weighted criteria. It transforms subjective comparisons into structured analysis.

## When to Use

Use a decision matrix when:

- You have 2+ options to compare
- Multiple factors influence the decision
- You want to reduce emotional bias
- The stakes justify systematic analysis

## Example: Investment Account Selection

Which account type should you prioritize for retirement savings?

<DecisionMatrix
  result={investmentResult}
  title="Investment Account Comparison"
/>

### How to Read This

1. **Winner** — The option with the highest weighted score
2. **Confidence** — How much the winner leads (low = close race)
3. **Scores** — Weighted contribution of each criterion
4. **Strengths/Weaknesses** — What each option excels at or lacks

## The Method

### 1. Define Options

List the choices you're comparing. Be specific:

- ❌ "Invest more"
- ✅ "Max 401(k)", "Max Roth IRA", "Taxable brokerage"

### 2. Define Criteria

What factors matter? Common financial criteria:

| Category | Criteria Examples |
|----------|-------------------|
| Returns | Growth potential, dividend yield, historical performance |
| Risk | Volatility, downside protection, diversification |
| Access | Liquidity, withdrawal penalties, loan options |
| Tax | Tax advantage, tax-loss harvesting, estate planning |
| Cost | Fees, expense ratios, transaction costs |

### 3. Assign Weights

Weights reflect importance. Must sum to 1.0 (or be auto-normalized).

```
Tax Advantage: 0.30 (30% importance)
Flexibility:   0.20 (20% importance)
Growth:        0.25 (25% importance)
Employer Match: 0.25 (25% importance)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total:         1.00
```

### 4. Score Each Option

Rate each option on each criterion (typically 1-10):

| Option | Tax | Flexibility | Growth | Match |
|--------|-----|-------------|--------|-------|
| 401(k) | 9 | 3 | 7 | 10 |
| Roth IRA | 8 | 6 | 8 | 0 |
| Taxable | 2 | 10 | 7 | 0 |

### 5. Calculate & Analyze

The matrix multiplies scores by weights and ranks options. The winner isn't always obvious—that's the point.

## Limitations

Decision matrices are tools, not oracles:

- **Garbage in, garbage out** — Scores and weights are still subjective
- **Doesn't capture everything** — Some factors resist quantification
- **False precision** — A score of 7.23 isn't meaningfully different from 7.18
- **Close races need judgment** — If confidence is low, other factors should decide
