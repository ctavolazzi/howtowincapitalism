## What is Asset Allocation?

**Asset allocation** is how you divide your investments among different asset classes—primarily stocks (equity) and bonds (fixed income). It's the most important investment decision you'll make, accounting for ~90% of long-term portfolio returns.

The good news: it's simpler than the finance industry wants you to believe.

## The Core Trade-Off

| Asset Class | Expected Return | Volatility | Best For |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Stocks** | ~7% (inflation-adjusted) | High | Long-term growth |
| **Bonds** | ~2-3% (inflation-adjusted) | Low | Stability, income |
| **Cash** | ~0% (inflation-adjusted) | None | Emergency fund, short-term |

**The principle:** Stocks grow faster but fluctuate more. Bonds grow slower but fluctuate less. Your mix depends on your timeline and risk tolerance.

## The Simple Formula

A common starting point:

**Stock allocation = 110 - Your Age**

| Age | Stocks | Bonds |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 25 | 85% | 15% |
| 35 | 75% | 25% |
| 45 | 65% | 35% |
| 55 | 55% | 45% |
| 65 | 45% | 55% |

**More aggressive:** Use 120 - Age (more stocks)
**More conservative:** Use 100 - Age (more bonds)

<Collapsible title="Why Age Matters">

**Young investors (20s-30s):**
- Decades until retirement
- Can ride out market crashes
- Human capital (future earnings) is bond-like
- Should be heavily in stocks (80-100%)

**Mid-career (40s-50s):**
- Still 15-25 years to grow
- Some stability matters
- Balanced approach (60-80% stocks)

**Near/in retirement (60s+):**
- Need money soon
- Can't wait out crashes
- Stability is critical
- More bonds (40-60% stocks)

The math: if the market drops 50% when you're 25, you have 40 years to recover. If it drops 50% when you're 65, you might never recover before needing the money.

## The Simplest Portfolios

You don't need a complex portfolio. Here are three approaches that work:

### 1. Target Date Fund (Easiest)

**What it is:** One fund that automatically adjusts your allocation as you age.

**How it works:** Pick the fund closest to your expected retirement year (e.g., "Target 2055 Fund" if retiring around 2055). The fund handles everything—allocation, rebalancing, diversification.

**Cost:** 0.10-0.15% expense ratio at Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab

**Best for:** Anyone who wants to set it and forget it.

### 2. Three-Fund Portfolio (Simple)

**What it is:** Three index funds covering the entire market:

| Fund | Allocation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| US Total Stock Market | 60% | VTSAX, FSKAX, SWTSX |
| International Stock | 20% | VTIAX, FTIHX, SWISX |
| US Bond Market | 20% | VBTLX, FXNAX, SWAGX |

**How it works:** Buy these three funds in your chosen ratio. Rebalance annually.

**Cost:** 0.03-0.10% expense ratio

**Best for:** Those who want slightly more control and lower fees.

### 3. Two-Fund Portfolio (Simplest)

**What it is:** Two funds only:

| Fund | Allocation | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Total World Stock | 80% | VTWAX, VT |
| Total Bond Market | 20% | VBTLX, BND |

**Cost:** 0.06-0.10% expense ratio

**Best for:** Ultimate simplicity with global diversification.

<Collapsible title="Why Index Funds Win">

**The evidence is overwhelming:**

- ~80% of active fund managers underperform their benchmark index over 15+ years
- The average actively managed fund charges 0.5-1.5% vs 0.03-0.10% for index funds
- That fee difference compounds to hundreds of thousands over a career

**The math:** $10,000 invested at 7% for 30 years
- Index fund (0.05% fee): **$74,000**
- Active fund (1.00% fee): **$57,000**

The index fund investor has 30% more money, just from lower fees.

## What NOT to Do

### 1. Don't Pick Individual Stocks

Unless you're a professional investor spending 40+ hours/week on research, you're gambling, not investing. Index funds give you the entire market's return without the risk of picking losers.

### 2. Don't Time the Market

"I'll wait for the crash" or "I'll sell before it drops" are fantasies. Studies show most market timing attempts reduce returns. Time IN the market beats timing the market.

### 3. Don't Chase Performance

Last year's hot fund is often next year's loser. Past performance doesn't predict future returns. Stick with your allocation regardless of recent performance.

### 4. Don't Over-Diversify

Owning 10+ funds doesn't reduce risk—it just adds complexity. A three-fund portfolio is already globally diversified across thousands of companies.

### 5. Don't Check Too Often

Checking daily leads to emotional decisions. Check quarterly at most. Rebalance annually.

## Rebalancing

Over time, your allocation drifts as some assets grow faster than others. **Rebalancing** brings it back to target.

**Example:**
- Target: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- After a good year: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- Rebalance: Sell some stocks, buy bonds to return to 80/20

**When to rebalance:**
- Calendar method: Once per year (simple)
- Threshold method: When allocation drifts 5%+ from target

**How to rebalance:**
1. Contribute new money to the underweight asset (no selling needed)
2. In tax-advantaged accounts: Sell and rebuy freely
3. In taxable accounts: Minimize selling to avoid taxes

<Collapsible title="Tax-Efficient Placement">

Different accounts have different tax treatment. Place assets strategically:

| Asset | Best Location | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Bonds | Tax-advantaged (401k, IRA) | Interest is taxed as income |
| International stocks | Taxable | Foreign tax credit available |
| US stocks | Either | Qualified dividends taxed lower |
| REITs | Tax-advantaged | Dividends taxed as income |

**Simple version:** Put bonds in retirement accounts, stocks wherever.

## Account Priority

Where you invest matters as much as what you invest in. See [Tax-Advantaged Accounts](/protocol/tax-advantaged-accounts/) for details, but the order is:

1. **401(k) to employer match** — Free money
2. **HSA max** — Triple tax advantage
3. **Roth IRA max** — Tax-free growth
4. **401(k) to max** — Tax-deferred growth
5. **Taxable brokerage** — After tax-advantaged space is full

## Common Questions

<Collapsible title="'Should I invest now or wait for a crash?'">

Invest now. Historically, markets go up more than they go down. Waiting for a crash means missing gains. Even investing at the worst possible moment (market peaks) beats waiting in cash over long periods.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="'What about real estate / crypto / gold?'">

These are optional tilts, not core holdings:
- **Real estate:** Already in total stock market (REITs). Direct ownership is a job, not passive investing.
- **Crypto:** Highly speculative. If you want exposure, limit to less than 5% of portfolio.
- **Gold:** Historically returns less than stocks with similar volatility. Not recommended for core allocation.

A simple stock/bond portfolio is sufficient for most investors.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="'Should I hire a financial advisor?'">

For basic investing, probably not. A simple index fund portfolio requires no professional help.

Consider an advisor if:
- You have complex tax situations
- You need help with estate planning
- You lack discipline to stay the course
- You have >$1M and want comprehensive planning

If you do hire someone, use a **fee-only fiduciary** (paid hourly or flat fee, legally required to act in your interest). Avoid advisors who earn commissions on products.

## The Investing Checklist

- [ ] **Emergency fund:** 3-6 months expenses in cash
- [ ] **Employer match:** Contributing enough to get full match
- [ ] **Asset allocation:** Decided based on age/timeline
- [ ] **Investment selection:** Low-cost index funds or target date
- [ ] **Rebalancing plan:** Annual check
- [ ] **Automation:** Auto-contributions set up
- [ ] **Don't touch it:** Ignore short-term fluctuations

## The Bottom Line

Investment allocation is:
- **Simple** — Target date fund or 3-fund portfolio
- **Age-based** — More stocks when young, more bonds when older
- **Low-cost** — Index funds beat most active funds
- **Hands-off** — Set it, forget it, rebalance annually

The best portfolio is the one you'll stick with through market ups and downs. Complexity doesn't improve returns—simplicity and consistency do.
