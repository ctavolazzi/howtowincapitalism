## Career as Strategy

Your career is likely your largest financial asset. The difference between a good career decision and a bad one can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.

Yet most people evaluate job offers with gut instinct and a salary comparison. That's not strategy—that's guessing.

## Total Compensation (Not Just Salary)

**Salary is not compensation.** Total compensation includes everything of value:

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Base salary** | Fixed annual pay |
| **Bonus** | Variable, often 10-30% at senior levels |
| **Equity/Stock** | RSUs, options, ESPP (can be significant) |
| **401(k) match** | Free money—calculate the dollar value |
| **Health insurance** | Employer-paid premium can be $10-20k/year |
| **HSA contributions** | Employer contribution is tax-free money |
| **Other benefits** | Education, transit, gym, meals, etc. |

<Collapsible title="Example: Two Offers Compared">

**Offer A:** $120,000 salary

**Offer B:** $105,000 salary + $15,000 annual bonus + $20,000 RSU vest/year + 6% 401k match

**True comparison:**

| Component | Offer A | Offer B |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Base | $120,000 | $105,000 |
| Bonus | $0 | $15,000 |
| Equity | $0 | $20,000 |
| 401k match (on 6%) | $0 | $6,300 |
| **Total** | **$120,000** | **$146,300** |

Offer B is worth $26,300 more per year despite a lower base salary.

## The Career Decision Framework

When evaluating a job change or offer, consider five dimensions:

### 1. Compensation (Short-term)

- Total compensation (not just salary)
- Signing bonus / relocation
- Cost of living adjustment if moving

### 2. Growth (Long-term)

- Learning opportunities
- Career progression path
- Skill development
- Resume/brand building

### 3. Stability

- Company financial health
- Industry outlook
- Job security
- Vesting schedules (golden handcuffs)

### 4. Work-Life Balance

- Hours expected
- Remote/hybrid flexibility
- PTO policy and culture
- Travel requirements
- On-call expectations

### 5. Culture & Fit

- Management quality
- Team dynamics
- Company values alignment
- Day-to-day enjoyment

## Decision Matrix: Job Offer Comparison

export const jobResult = makeDecision({
  options: ['Current Job', 'Startup Offer', 'Big Tech Offer', 'Consulting Offer'],
  criteria: ['Total Comp', 'Growth', 'Stability', 'Work-Life Balance', 'Culture Fit'],
  weights: [0.25, 0.25, 0.15, 0.20, 0.15],
  scores: {
    'Current Job': [6, 5, 8, 7, 7],
    'Startup Offer': [5, 9, 4, 4, 8],
    'Big Tech Offer': [9, 7, 8, 6, 5],
    'Consulting Offer': [8, 8, 7, 3, 6]
  }
});

<DecisionMatrix result={jobResult} title="Job Offer Comparison (Example)" />

**Adjust weights for your situation:**
- Early career? Weight **Growth** higher
- Have a family? Weight **Work-Life Balance** higher
- Risk-averse? Weight **Stability** higher
- Need cash now? Weight **Total Comp** higher

## When to Leave Your Job

Consider leaving when:

- ✅ **You've stopped learning** — Growth has plateaued
- ✅ **You're significantly underpaid** — Market rate is 20%+ higher
- ✅ **The environment is toxic** — Bad management, poor culture
- ✅ **There's no path forward** — Promotion is blocked
- ✅ **You have a better offer** — That meets your criteria

Consider staying when:

- ❌ **You're running away** — New job won't fix the real issue
- ❌ **You haven't negotiated** — Try fixing compensation first
- ❌ **Unvested equity is significant** — Calculate the true cost of leaving
- ❌ **The grass isn't greener** — New job has same problems
- ❌ **You're making emotional decisions** — Bad day ≠ bad job

<Collapsible title="The 'Unvested Equity' Trap" variant="warning">

If you have $100,000 in unvested stock vesting over 2 years, leaving costs you $100,000. That's a $50k/year pay cut.

A new job needs to compensate for this, either through:
- Signing bonus to offset the loss
- Higher total compensation
- Significantly better growth/opportunity

Don't underestimate what you're leaving on the table.

## Negotiation Basics

### Know Your Leverage

Your leverage is highest when:
- You have competing offers
- You have rare/in-demand skills
- They've invested time in hiring you
- The role has been open a long time

### What to Negotiate

| Always Negotiate | Sometimes Negotiate | Hard to Negotiate |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Base salary | Equity/RSUs | Benefits (company-wide) |
| Signing bonus | Vacation days | PTO policy |
| Start date | Title | Work hours |
| Remote flexibility | Relocation | Vesting schedule |

### How to Negotiate

1. **Get the offer in writing** first
2. **Express enthusiasm** — Don't be adversarial
3. **Counter with justification** — Market data, competing offers, specific skills
4. **Ask, don't demand** — "Is there flexibility on..."
5. **Get the final offer in writing**

<Collapsible title="Sample Negotiation Script">

**After receiving offer:**

"Thank you for this offer—I'm very excited about the role and the team. I've been doing some market research, and based on my experience with [specific skill] and the [competing offer / market data], I was hoping we could discuss the base salary. Is there flexibility to move closer to $X?"

**Key elements:**
- Gratitude and enthusiasm
- Justification (not entitlement)
- Specific ask with rationale
- Question format (collaborative)

## The Job Search Strategy

### If Employed

- **Never quit before you have an offer** — You lose all leverage
- **Keep searches confidential** — Don't tell coworkers
- **Interview strategically** — Take PTO, schedule around work
- **Don't badmouth current employer** — Red flag to recruiters

### If Unemployed

- **Savings runway matters** — See [Emergency Fund](/protocol/emergency-fund/)
- **Don't take the first offer** — Unless you must
- **Fill gaps productively** — Freelance, volunteer, skill-building
- **Address the gap directly** — Have a concise explanation

## Common Mistakes

<Collapsible title="Chasing salary at the expense of growth" variant="warning">

A $10,000 raise at a dead-end job costs you more than a $10,000 pay cut at a high-growth opportunity. Early career especially—optimize for learning, not earning.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Ignoring total compensation" variant="warning">

Stock options, 401k matches, and health insurance premiums can be worth $20-50k+ annually. Comparing only base salary is comparing apples to oranges.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Not negotiating" variant="warning">

Most offers have 5-15% flexibility. Not asking costs thousands per year, compounding over your career. The worst they can say is no.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Emotional decisions" variant="warning">

Bad week at work? Difficult project? These are temporary. Quitting in frustration often leads to worse situations. Wait until you can think clearly.

## Career Compounding

Like money, career decisions compound:

| Year | Good Decisions | Mediocre Decisions |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $80k (learning fast) | $85k (comfortable) |
| 5 | $150k (senior role) | $100k (same role) |
| 10 | $250k (leadership) | $120k (individual contributor) |
| 20 | $400k+ (executive) | $150k (senior IC) |

The person who took "less money for more learning" early career often earns multiples more later. Compound growth applies to skills and reputation, not just money.

## The Bottom Line

Career decisions are:
- **Total compensation** — Salary is just one component
- **Multi-dimensional** — Growth, stability, balance, culture all matter
- **Personal** — Your weights depend on your life stage
- **Compounding** — Early career decisions have outsized impact

Don't optimize for salary. Optimize for the career that builds wealth, skills, and satisfaction over decades.
