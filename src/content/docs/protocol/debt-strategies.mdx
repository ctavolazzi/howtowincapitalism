## What Are Debt Payoff Strategies?

**Debt payoff strategies** are systematic approaches to eliminating multiple debts. The two main methods — Avalanche and Snowball — differ in whether you prioritize math or psychology.

Both work. The best one is the one you'll actually stick with.

## The Two Methods

### Avalanche Method (Math-Optimal)

**How it works:** Pay minimum on all debts, then throw every extra dollar at the **highest interest rate** debt first.

**Why it works:** Interest is the enemy. Attacking the highest rate first minimizes total interest paid.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Pays least total interest | Slow early wins if high-rate debt is large |
| Mathematically optimal | Can feel like no progress |
| Saves the most money | Requires discipline |

### Snowball Method (Psychology-Optimal)

**How it works:** Pay minimum on all debts, then throw every extra dollar at the **smallest balance** debt first.

**Why it works:** Quick wins build momentum. Eliminating debts entirely feels good and keeps you motivated.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Quick early wins | Pays more total interest |
| Builds psychological momentum | Not mathematically optimal |
| Easier to stick with | Ignores interest rates |

## Example: Same Debts, Different Strategies

**Starting debts:**

| Debt | Balance | Interest Rate | Minimum |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Credit Card A | $2,000 | 24% | $50 |
| Credit Card B | $5,000 | 18% | $100 |
| Car Loan | $8,000 | 6% | $200 |
| Student Loan | $15,000 | 5% | $150 |

**Extra payment available:** $300/month beyond minimums

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Avalanche (by interest rate)">
    **Payment order:**
    <Steps>
      1. Credit Card A (24%) — paid off in ~6 months
      2. Credit Card B (18%) — paid off in ~14 months
      3. Car Loan (6%) — paid off in ~24 months
      4. Student Loan (5%) — paid off in ~36 months
    </Steps>

    **Total interest paid:** ~$4,200  
    **Time to debt-free:** ~36 months
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Snowball (by balance)">
    **Payment order:**
    <Steps>
      1. Credit Card A ($2,000) — paid off in ~6 months
      2. Credit Card B ($5,000) — paid off in ~14 months
      3. Car Loan ($8,000) — paid off in ~24 months
      4. Student Loan ($15,000) — paid off in ~36 months
    </Steps>

    **Total interest paid:** ~$4,800  
    **Time to debt-free:** ~36 months

    **Note:** In this example, the order happens to be similar because the smallest debt also has the highest rate. That's not always the case.

## Which Should You Use?

### Use Avalanche If:
- You're motivated by math and optimization
- Your highest-rate debt isn't enormous
- You have strong financial discipline
- Saving money matters more than quick wins

### Use Snowball If:
- You need early wins to stay motivated
- You've failed at debt payoff before
- Your smallest debts can be eliminated quickly
- The psychological boost is worth the extra cost

### Use a Hybrid If:
- Your highest-rate debt is also relatively small (lucky you)
- You want to clear one quick win, then switch to avalanche
- You have a mix of small annoying debts and large serious debts

## The Math vs. Psychology Trade-Off

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **the mathematically optimal strategy only works if you follow it.**

Studies show people using the Snowball method are more likely to complete their debt payoff journey — even though they pay more interest. The psychological momentum of eliminating debts entirely outweighs the mathematical inefficiency.

**The best strategy is the one you'll finish.**

## Before You Start: The Starter Emergency Fund

Before aggressively paying debt, build a **$1,000 starter emergency fund**. Why?

Without it, every emergency becomes new debt. You're running on a treadmill. The starter fund breaks the cycle.

See [Emergency Fund](/protocol/emergency-fund/) for details.

## Common Mistakes

<Aside type="caution" title="Don't close cards after payoff">
Paying off a credit card doesn't mean you should close it. Closing cards:
- Reduces your total credit limit
- Increases your credit utilization ratio
- Shortens your credit history
- Can hurt your credit score

Instead: Pay it off, cut it up if needed, but leave the account open.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Never ignore minimum payments">
Both methods require paying **all minimums** on **all debts** every month. The extra payment goes to the target debt. Miss a minimum and you'll:
- Pay late fees
- Trigger penalty interest rates
- Damage your credit score
- Undo your progress

Automate minimums. Never miss them.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Build an emergency fund first">
Putting every dollar toward debt without a buffer means any unexpected expense becomes new debt. You're making negative progress. Build at least $1,000 first.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Avoid lifestyle inflation during payoff">
Getting a raise? Paying off a debt? Don't increase spending. Redirect that money to the next debt. Lifestyle inflation extends your debt-free date by years.
</Aside>

## Advanced: Debt Consolidation

**What it is:** Combining multiple debts into one loan, ideally at a lower interest rate.

**When it makes sense:**
- Your credit is good enough for a lower rate
- You won't rack up new debt on the cleared cards
- The math actually saves money (watch for fees)

**When it's a trap:**
- You consolidate, then spend on the cleared cards
- The new loan has hidden fees that erase savings
- You're extending the timeline significantly

Consolidation is a tool, not a solution. The solution is spending less than you earn and directing the difference to debt.

## The Debt-Free Milestone

When you pay off your last debt, redirect that payment to:

1. **Full emergency fund** — 3-6 months of expenses
2. **Retirement accounts** — Max tax-advantaged contributions
3. **Other goals** — House down payment, education, investments

See [Tax-Advantaged Accounts](/protocol/tax-advantaged-accounts/) for the recommended order.

## The Bottom Line

Debt strategies are:
- **Avalanche** — Math-optimal, highest rate first, saves the most money
- **Snowball** — Psychology-optimal, smallest balance first, fastest wins
- **Personal** — The best method is the one you'll actually complete
- **Not magic** — Both require spending less than you earn

Pick one. Start today. The interest clock is running.
