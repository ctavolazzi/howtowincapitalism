## What is The Protocol?

**The Protocol** is a framework for understanding how modern capitalism works and how to navigate it effectively. It is not about "getting rich quick" — it is about understanding the rules of the game well enough to make informed decisions.

## Core Principles

1. **Understand the system** — You cannot win a game you do not understand
2. **Own your time** — Time is the only non-renewable resource
3. **Build assets** — Things that work for you while you sleep
4. **Reduce dependencies** — Minimize single points of failure
5. **Document everything** — Knowledge compounds over time

## How to Use This Wiki

This wiki is organized into two main sections:

- **The Protocol** — Definitions, concepts, and frameworks
- **Field Notes** — Real-world observations and updates

Start by reading through The Protocol to understand the foundational concepts, then follow Field Notes for ongoing updates and practical applications.

  items={[
    {
      question: "Is this financial advice?",
      answer: "No. This wiki documents concepts and frameworks for educational purposes. We are not licensed financial advisors. Always consult qualified professionals for personal financial decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the 'satirical' part about?",
      answer: "The title 'How To Win Capitalism' is tongue-in-cheek. We recognize that the system has problems. The satire is in taking the game seriously enough to document it like a strategy guide—because for most people, opting out isn't an option."
    },
    {
      question: "Who maintains this wiki?",
      answer: "People who got tired of learning expensive lessons the hard way. We document what we learn so others don't have to repeat our mistakes. Contributions and corrections are welcome."
    },
    {
      question: "Why Wikipedia-style?",
      answer: "Wikipedia's design prioritizes information density, readability, and accessibility. It's proven to work for encyclopedic content. We borrowed the aesthetic because it works, not because we're affiliated with Wikipedia."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is this updated?",
      answer: "Regularly. Check <a href='/field-notes/latest/'>Latest Updates</a> for recent changes. The Protocol section contains foundational content that changes less frequently. Field Notes capture ongoing observations."
