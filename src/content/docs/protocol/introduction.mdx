## What is The Protocol?

**The Protocol** is a framework for understanding how modern capitalism works and how to navigate it effectively. It is not about "getting rich quick" — it is about understanding the rules of the game well enough to make informed decisions.

## Core Principles

1. **Understand the system** — You cannot win a game you do not understand
2. **Own your time** — Time is the only non-renewable resource
3. **Build assets** — Things that work for you while you sleep
4. **Reduce dependencies** — Minimize single points of failure
5. **Document everything** — Knowledge compounds over time
