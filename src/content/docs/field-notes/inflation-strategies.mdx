## The Inflation Problem

Inflation is a silent tax on your savings. When prices rise 3% per year and your savings account pays 0.5%, you're losing 2.5% of your purchasing power annually.

**The math:** $10,000 today at 3% inflation = $7,440 purchasing power in 10 years.

You're not getting poorer on paper. You're getting poorer in reality.

## Understanding Inflation Types

| Type | Cause | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Demand-pull** | Too much money chasing goods | Stimulus checks → spending surge |
| **Cost-push** | Production costs rise | Oil prices → everything costs more |
| **Built-in** | Wage-price spiral | Workers demand raises → prices rise → repeat |

For personal finance, the *cause* matters less than the *response*. Your strategies should work regardless of inflation type.

## The Inflation Protection Hierarchy

<Steps>
1. **Don't hold excess cash** — Keep 3-6 months emergency fund, invest the rest
2. **Use high-yield savings** — At least keep pace with some inflation
3. **Own productive assets** — Stocks, real estate, businesses
4. **Consider inflation-linked securities** — I-Bonds, TIPS
5. **Avoid long-term fixed-rate lending** — Your bond's 3% looks terrible when inflation hits 6%
</Steps>

## Specific Strategies

### 1. I-Bonds (Best Risk-Free Option)

**What:** US government savings bonds that adjust for inflation.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Rate | Fixed rate + inflation adjustment (CPI) |
| Purchase limit | $10,000/year per SSN (electronic) |
| Lock-up | 1 year minimum, 3-month interest penalty if redeemed before 5 years |
| Tax | Federal only, can defer until redemption |
| Where | TreasuryDirect.gov |

<Aside type="tip" title="I-Bond Strategy">
Buy $10,000 in I-Bonds annually. After 5 years, you have $50,000 in inflation-protected savings with no penalty for withdrawal. This becomes your "inflation-proof" emergency fund layer.
</Aside>

### 2. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)

**What:** Treasury bonds where principal adjusts with CPI.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Liquidity | Tradeable (unlike I-Bonds) |
| Purchase limit | None |
| Tax quirk | Pay tax on inflation adjustment annually ("phantom income") |
| Best held in | Tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA) |

**When TIPS beat I-Bonds:** Large amounts, need liquidity, already maxed I-Bonds.

### 3. Stocks (Long-Term Inflation Hedge)

Companies can raise prices with inflation. Their revenues (and your shares) grow nominally even if real growth is flat.

| Sector | Inflation Performance | Why |
|--------|----------------------|-----|
| **Consumer staples** | Good | People buy necessities regardless |
| **Energy** | Good | Oil/gas prices often drive inflation |
| **Real estate (REITs)** | Good | Rents adjust upward |
| **Utilities** | Mixed | Regulated pricing limits flexibility |
| **Growth stocks** | Poor | Future earnings discounted more heavily |

<Aside type="caution" title="Short-Term Warning">
Stocks are volatile. In the short term, inflation spikes can hurt stocks (as the Fed raises rates). The inflation hedge only works over 10+ year horizons.
</Aside>

### 4. Real Estate

Property values and rents tend to rise with inflation. But real estate has costs:

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Tangible asset | Illiquid |
| Rental income adjusts | Maintenance costs also inflate |
| Leverage amplifies gains | Leverage amplifies losses |
| Tax advantages | Management headaches |

**Alternative:** REITs give real estate exposure without the landlord hassles.

### 5. Commodities (Speculative)

Gold, oil, agricultural products often rise with inflation. But:

- No yield (gold doesn't pay dividends)
- High volatility
- Storage/trading costs
- Timing is nearly impossible

**Verdict:** Small allocation (5-10%) if any. Not a core strategy.

## What NOT to Do

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Don't Hoard Cash">
    Cash loses value every day inflation exceeds your interest rate. Keep only what you need for emergencies and near-term expenses.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Don't Panic Buy">
    "Inflation is high, buy gold/crypto/commodities NOW" is usually wrong. These assets are already priced for current inflation expectations.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Don't Lock in Low Rates">
    Avoid long-term CDs or bonds when inflation is rising. You're locking in a loss.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Don't Over-Leverage">
    Yes, inflation erodes debt. No, this doesn't mean load up on debt. The payments still have to be made.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The Practical Playbook

<Steps>
1. **Emergency fund:** High-yield savings (currently 4-5% APY)
2. **First $10k beyond that:** I-Bonds annually
3. **Retirement accounts:** Broad stock index funds (automatic inflation hedge)
4. **Taxable accounts:** Mix of stocks and TIPS if concerned
5. **Review annually:** Adjust based on current inflation environment
</Steps>

## Inflation and Debt

Inflation can help borrowers—your fixed mortgage payment becomes "cheaper" in real terms as wages rise.

| Debt Type | Inflation Impact |
|-----------|------------------|
| Fixed-rate mortgage | ✅ Helps (payment stays same, income rises) |
| Variable-rate debt | ❌ Hurts (rate rises with inflation) |
| Student loans | Mixed (depends on rate type) |
| Credit cards | ❌ Hurts (rates rise fast) |

<Aside type="note" title="Don't Borrow to Bet on Inflation">
"Inflation will erode my debt" is not a reason to take on debt. It's a silver lining for debt you already have.
</Aside>

## The Bottom Line

Inflation protection is:
- **Essential** — Cash loses value; you must invest
- **Simple** — Stocks + I-Bonds cover most needs
- **Long-term** — Short-term hedges are usually speculation
- **Automatic** — A diversified portfolio already provides inflation protection

Don't overthink it. A standard stock/bond portfolio with some I-Bonds handles inflation for most people. The goal isn't to "beat" inflation—it's to not lose to it.
