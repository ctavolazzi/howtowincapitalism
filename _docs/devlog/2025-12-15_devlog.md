# Devlog: December 15, 2025

**Time:** Morning  
**Session:** Auth Playbook Baseline  
**Work Effort:** 10.14 Auth Playbook Baseline

---

## Summary

Captured a one-size-fits-most authentication playbook tailored to our Cloudflare Workers + KV stack, plus guidance for when to introduce an external IdP.

## Notes

- Added a new playbook section to `_docs/technical/AUTHENTICATION.md` covering design principles, baseline controls, reliability/ops, RBAC/tenancy, IdP decision triggers, and a project-specific checklist.
- Logged the effort in `_work_efforts/10-19_development/10_active/10.14_auth_playbook_baseline.md` with follow-up to schedule MFA expansion and telemetry tasks.
- Drafted an implementation plan (phased hardening, MFA expansion, operational resilience) inside `10.14_auth_playbook_baseline.md`; next step is to break into tickets with owners/estimates.
