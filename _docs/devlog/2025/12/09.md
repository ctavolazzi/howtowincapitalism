- Completeness Meter — Track learning progress
- Favorites — Bookmark articles
- See Also — Formalize related links

**Tier 3 (Future):**
- Search Filters — Category filtering
- Wizard — Guided decision making
- Tag Cloud — Concept visualization

### 5:30 AM — Phase 1 Components Built

Created 5 new components implementing UI patterns:

| Component | Type | Pattern | Lines |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| `Breadcrumbs.astro` | atom | Breadcrumbs | ~95 |
| `TopicCard.astro` | molecule | Cards | ~115 |
| `CardGrid.astro` | utility | Grid Layout | ~70 |
| `Footer.astro` | organism | Fat Footer | ~175 |
| `SeeAlso.astro` | molecule | Related Content | ~85 |

**Total:** ~540 lines of component code

### Files Created

```
src/components/
├── atoms/
│   └── Breadcrumbs.astro      ← NEW (navigation hierarchy)
├── molecules/
│   ├── TopicCard.astro        ← NEW (content cards)
│   └── SeeAlso.astro          ← NEW (related links)
├── organisms/
│   └── Footer.astro           ← NEW (fat footer)
└── utilities/
    └── CardGrid.astro         ← NEW (responsive grid)
```

### Files Updated

```
src/components/index.ts        # Added new component exports
src/content/docs/index.mdx     # Added CardGrid + TopicCards
```

### Pattern Implementation Details

**Breadcrumbs:**
- Parses URL path into segments
- Converts kebab-case to Title Case
- Current page shown without link
- Accessible with aria-label

**TopicCard:**
- Clickable card with hover effects
- Optional tag, icon, description
- Wikipedia-inspired minimal style

**CardGrid:**
- 2/3/4 column responsive grid
- Auto-stacks on mobile
- Configurable gap sizes

**Footer (Fat Footer):**
- Three-column layout
- Navigation + Resources + About
- Responsive: stacks on mobile
- Copyright and meta links

**SeeAlso:**
- Wikipedia-style related links
- Optional descriptions per link
- Semantic HTML with list markup

### 5:28 AM — Loose Ends Fixed

**Issues identified and resolved:**

1. **ConceptCard not exported** — Added to `index.ts`
2. **Footer not integrated** — Added to Starlight component overrides in `astro.config.mjs`
3. **TopicCard vs ConceptCard overlap** — Both retained:
   - `TopicCard`: Vertical layout, tags, for index pages
   - `ConceptCard`: Horizontal layout, variants, for inline use

**Remaining:**
- Breadcrumbs: Starlight doesn't have a Breadcrumbs slot. Component is ready for manual use in MDX files or future layout override.

### 5:32 AM — Work Efforts Audit

Inspected all work efforts and found:

| Work Effort | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| `10.01` UI Patterns | ✅ Complete | None |

## Session 2: Performance & Sustainability Audit (5:25 AM - 5:35 AM)

**Work Effort:** [[10.02_performance_sustainability_audit]]

Applied 2026 web design trends focused on sustainability and performance optimization.

### Reference

Based on Designmodo article "Top Web Design Trends for 2026":
- Sustainability = reduced energy usage, smaller payloads
- Mobile-first = 60% of traffic is mobile
- Ethical design = respect user's time and device resources

### Audit Findings

| Asset | Size | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `dist/` total | 768KB | ✅ Excellent |
| `houston.webp` | 96KB | ❌ Unused (deleted) |
| Main CSS | 64KB | ⚠️ Includes Starlight |
| Pagefind | 348KB | ✅ Expected for search |

**Good News:**
- No external fonts (system fonts = fast)
- No third-party scripts
- Static site = minimal server load
- Cloudflare hosting = efficient CDN

### Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. Asset Cleanup
- Deleted unused `houston.webp` (96KB saved)
- Removed empty `src/assets/images/` folder

#### 2. CSS Performance (Section 9 Added)

```css
/* GPU-Accelerated Animations */
.hero__cta, button, [role="button"] {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translateZ(0);
}

/* Content Visibility */
footer {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: 0 100px;
}

/* Layout Containment */
.wiki-box, details, .hero {
  contain: layout style;
}
```

#### 3. Resource Hints (astro.config.mjs)
- Added DNS prefetch placeholder
- Added viewport meta with `viewport-fit: cover`

#### 4. Enhanced Print Styles
- Show link URLs when printing
- Remove all visual effects

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/styles/custom.css` | +70 lines (Section 9: Performance) |
| `astro.config.mjs` | Resource hints, viewport meta |
| `src/assets/houston.webp` | Deleted (unused) |

### Performance Techniques Used

| Technique | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| `will-change` | Hints GPU to prepare for animation |
| `translateZ(0)` | Forces GPU layer creation |
| `content-visibility: auto` | Skips rendering below-fold content |
| `contain: layout style` | Isolates component rendering |
| System fonts | Zero font download |
| Static generation | No server processing |

### Sustainability Statement

This site is designed to be:
- **Lightweight** — 768KB total build
- **Efficient** — System fonts, lazy rendering
- **Accessible** — Works on slow connections
- **Green** — Cloudflare's efficient edge network
- **Respectful** — `prefers-reduced-motion` support

---

*Session 2 complete: 5:35 AM PST*

---

## Session 3: Navigation reset & TOC contrast (12:50 PM PST)

**Work Effort:** [[10.01_ui_patterns_enhancement]] / navigation polish

### What changed
- Removed brittle header/nav overrides and restored Starlight defaults so the built-in sidebar, mobile drawer, and header/search use upstream behavior (less `!important` risk).
- Re-enabled the table of contents (desktop and mobile) and set light-mode colors to match the Wikipedia palette for readability.
- Kept the forced-light palette via CSS variables; theme toggle stays hidden.

### Files touched
| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `src/styles/custom.css` | Removed heavy nav/header blocks, reinstated TOCs with readable colors |

### Verification
- `npm run build`

### Follow-ups
- If keeping the forced-light skin, consider cleaning remaining `!important` rules and aligning CSP so Pagefind search can initialize.

---

## Session 4: Work Efforts Audit & Documentation Update (6:00 AM PST)

**Work Effort:** Documentation & organization maintenance

### What Was Done

#### 1. Work Efforts Audit & Cleanup

Audited all work effort files and cleaned up the structure:

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Deleted duplicate | `10_active/10.01_ui_patterns_enhancement.md` (copy existed in `11_completed/`) |
| Moved completed work | `10.02_performance_sustainability_audit.md` → `11_completed/` |
| Moved completed work | `10.01_2026-design-trends-implementation.md` → `11_completed/` |
| Updated checkboxes | Fixed stale task statuses in completed work efforts |
| Deleted empty folder | `10_design/` (emptied after moves) |

#### 2. Discovered Decision Matrix Presets Already Done

Created work effort `10.03_decision_matrix_presets.md`, then discovered the feature was already implemented:
- 4 real-world examples exist on Decision Matrix page
- Investment, Job, Side Hustle, Housing comparisons
- All wrapped in `<Collapsible>` for progressive disclosure

**Resolution:** Closed as "already implemented" and moved to completed.

#### 3. ARCHITECTURE.md Update

Updated component inventory to reflect all new components created during UI Pattern Enhancement:

| Category | Components Added |
|----------|------------------|
| Atoms | Breadcrumbs, Collapsible |
| Molecules | TopicCard, SeeAlso, FAQ, BlankSlate, CompletenessMeter |
| Utilities | CardGrid |
| Organisms | Footer, Hero (available) |

#### 4. Component Registry Update

Updated `src/components/index.ts` header comment to accurately reflect:
- Active components (in use on pages)
- Available components (exported but not used)
- Reserved components (for future use)

#### 5. Content Expansion Work Effort

Created new work effort `10.04_content_expansion.md` to track adding more wiki content:

**Proposed content roadmap:**

| Phase | Focus | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Core Protocol | Compound Interest, Emergency Fund, Tax Accounts |

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_work_efforts/10-19_development/10_active/10.04_content_expansion.md` | New work effort |
| `_work_efforts/10-19_development/11_completed/10.03_decision_matrix_presets.md` | Closed work effort |

### Files Deleted

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `_work_efforts/10-19_development/10_active/10.01_ui_patterns_enhancement.md` | Duplicate |

### Components Now Used

| Starlight Component | Pages Using |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `<Tabs>` / `<TabItem>` | debt-strategies, rent-vs-buy |
| `<Steps>` | debt-strategies, rent-vs-buy |
| `<Aside type="caution">` | debt-strategies, rent-vs-buy |

### Key Decisions

1. **Keep custom Collapsible** — Better for FAQ-style expandable content
2. **Use Tabs for A/B comparisons** — Users see both options without clicking
3. **Use Aside for warnings** — Consistent with Starlight ecosystem
4. **Use Steps for procedures** — Visual distinction from regular lists

## Session 11: Reports, Favorites, CSS Cleanup (7:28 AM - 7:37 AM PST)

**Work Effort:** [[10.04_content_expansion]] (Phase 4 Reports)

### Phase 4 Reports - Complete

Created three report/template pages:

| Report | Lines | Content |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `financial-autonomy-checklist.mdx` | ~180 | 7-level checklist from foundation to FI |
| `decision-matrix-template.mdx` | ~150 | Blank template + example + guide |
| `tax-optimization-guide.mdx` | ~220 | Strategies by income level, common mistakes |

**Reports Index:** Updated from BlankSlate placeholder to CardGrid with 3 TopicCards.

### Favorites Component - Complete

Created `Favorites.astro` molecule:
- Add/remove pages from favorites via localStorage
- Star icon toggle on any page
- Favorites list display with remove buttons
- Added to homepage after CompletenessMeter

### CSS Cleanup

- **`!important` count:** 81 → 80 (minor reduction)
- **Added documentation:** Explained why `!important` is necessary (Starlight override)
- **Consolidated:** Table color rules simplified

**Key insight:** Most `!important` rules are required to override Starlight's theming system. Significant reduction would require forking Starlight's CSS or using CSS layers.

## Session 12: Debug Logging System (7:55 AM - 8:05 AM PST)

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive debug logging throughout the application for troubleshooting, diagnostics, and development refinement.

### Debug Module Created (`src/lib/debug.ts`)

Created a monolithic, toggleable debug logging system:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Auto-toggle | ON in dev mode, OFF in production |
| Force enable | `PUBLIC_DEBUG=true` env var or `localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')` |
| Module colors | Different console colors per module for visual scanning |
| Timestamps | Every log includes ISO timestamp |

### Debug Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `debug.log()` | Standard debug message |
| `debug.warn()` | Warning message |
| `debug.error()` | Error (always shows, even in prod) |
| `debug.success()` | Success confirmation |
| `debug.time()` | Performance timing (returns end function) |
| `debug.group()` / `groupEnd()` | Group related logs |
| `debug.table()` | Tabular data display |
| `debug.assert()` | Conditional logging |
| `debug.track()` | User interaction tracking |
| `debug.inspect()` | Deep object inspection |
| `debug.route()` | Navigation/route logging |
| `debug.storage()` | localStorage operation logging |

### Components with Logging Added

**Server-side (Astro frontmatter):**

| Component | What's Logged |
|-----------|---------------|
| `DecisionMatrix.astro` | Render info, winner, confidence, options |
| `WikiBox.astro` | Variant, title, padding |
| `TopicCard.astro` | Title, href, tag |
| `FAQ.astro` | Item count, title |
| `SeeAlso.astro` | Links count, titles |
| `Hero.astro` | Tagline, CTA info |
| `Breadcrumbs.astro` | Path segments, crumbs built |
| `Collapsible.astro` | Title, variant, open state |
| `Disclaimer.astro` | ID, text length |
| `Footer.astro` | Year |

**Client-side (script tags):**

| Component | What's Logged |
|-----------|---------------|
| `Header.astro` | Menu toggle, nav clicks, escape key |
| `CompletenessMeter.astro` | Progress %, visited pages, localStorage ops |
| `Favorites.astro` | Add/remove favorites, localStorage, toggle state |
| `Disclaimer.astro` | Dismiss state, localStorage persistence |
